Simple package for user-defined configuration by robust interface.

ðŸ“¦ Installation
---------------

It's best to use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) for installation, and you can also find the package on
[Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/baraja-core/dynamic-configuration) and
[GitHub](https://github.com/baraja-core/dynamic-configuration).

To install, simply use the command:

```
$ composer require baraja-core/dynamic-configuration
```

You can use the package manually by creating an instance of the internal classes, or register a DIC extension to link the services directly to the Nette Framework.
